# GreedyCellTowers

Consider a country with long roads and houses along the road. Assume that the residents of all houses use cell phones. We want to place cell phone towers along the road, and each cell phone tower covers a range of 9 miles. Create a greedy algorithm that allows the fewest cell phone towers.
Test and compare basic brute force algorithm, and a greedy algorithm.

### Test Case 1
Assume the road starts at mile marker 0, and houses are located at the following mile markers:
3, 5, 8, 10, 14, 19, 21, 25, 29, 31, 37, 39, 44, 55, 59, 63, 66, 69, 75, 80.

### Test Case 2
Randomly generate a set of 1000000 houses from miles 0-4000000.
